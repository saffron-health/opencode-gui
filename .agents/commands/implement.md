You are tasked with implementing a feature/fix based on a provided spec sheet.

Follow the implementation process below systematically.

## Implementation Process

1. **Read and analyze the spec**: Understand the problem, solution, and all implementation tasks
2. **Plan with todos**: Use `todo_write` to create a comprehensive todo list from the spec's checkbox items
3. **Implement systematically**: Work through each todo item in logical order, marking them as in-progress and completed
4. **Quality assurance**: Complete the Sanity Check section tasks as specified in the spec
5. **Verify completion**: Ensure all spec requirements are met and update the spec to mark all todos as done
