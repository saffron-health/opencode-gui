Pick the first thing off @TODO.md and do it.

For the todo, start by thoroughly researching and writing your notes into `thoughts/todos/<todo-name>.md`.

After researching and making a spec about how to do the task, do it. After its done, update the spec about what was completed and how far you got.

If you run into implementation issues or confusing debugging reasons, use the Oracle to debug. It's really smart.

After you're done, update the todo in @TODO.md. If it was completed, use an "x". If you got blocked or only made some progress, use "-" Add a status update under the todo itself, and add a pointer to the todo docs file. If you got blocked by something, put the reason why in the status update and expand on it in the todo file.

If there is leftover work to do, add it to the docs file in a "Progress" section. Then add or update any TODOs in the TODO.md file to finish it back up. Make sure the todo description is a full one or two sentences, detailing any context someone will need to know to pick up the task.

Finally, commit your changes in Git.
