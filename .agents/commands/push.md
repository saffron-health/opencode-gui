If on main, checkout a new branch first. Commit the changes in the current branch. Use gh cli to see if a PR exists already. If it doesn't, create one with an appropriate title and description. If a PR does exist, query the current title and description, and update it if appropriate. Then push the changes. For any follow-up edits in this session, continue to commit and push and update the PR if appropriate.
